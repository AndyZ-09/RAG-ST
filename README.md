# RAG-ST
Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a powerful and emerging technology that captures gene expression profiles with spatial resolution, providing unprecedented insight into cellular organization and tissue microenvironments. However, widespread adoption of ST is limited by its high cost and technical complexity. Histology imaging, in contrast, is inexpensive and widely accessible. If we could accurately predict gene expression from histology images, we could enable broader access to high-resolution biological insights without the need for costly experiments. This project proposes RAG-ST, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for predicting spatial gene expression from histology images, combining vision-based encoders with interpretable retrieval-based gene expression generation. Our framework emphasizes biological interpretability, prior knowledge utilization, and modular design for flexible and scalable deployment.
